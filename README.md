As you may know (or not), the exponential function can be written as the sum of a power series:

So does many other functions, such as trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

These power series are extremely handy when it comes to fast approximations of all those functions. But
they can also be used to exponentiate (for instance) mathematical objects (as long as they can be elevated
to integer powers). One could for example compute the cosine of a function, the exponentiation of a graph,
the hyperbolic tangent of a rotation or the sine of a square matrix (which is what you will do here)...

Given a matrix and the name of a function, your program must apply the latter to the former, and print the
result (matrix-managing libraries are not allowed).
